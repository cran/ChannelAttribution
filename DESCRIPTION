Description: Advertisers use a variety of online marketing channels to reach consumers and they want to know the degree each channel contributes to their marketing success. This is called online multi-channel attribution problem. This package contains a probabilistic algorithm for the attribution problem. The model uses a k-order Markov representation to identify structural correlations in the customer journey data. The package also contains three heuristic algorithms (first-touch, last-touch and linear-touch approach) for the same problem. The algorithms are implemented in C++.
